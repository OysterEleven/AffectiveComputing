This software consists of a series of Matlab routines useful for
various aspects of prosodic analysis of speech, in particular F0
and harmonic analysis, loudness analysis, and voice-source analysis. 
Much of this software was written to support the research outlined
in "A Computational Model for the Automatic Recognition of Affect in
Speech" (downloadable from http://web.media.mit.edu/~galt/phdthesis.pdf).
You may find it most useful if you're familiar with that work.

To access all the routines, you may want to run the setUpPaths.m file
included in this distribution, or modify your MATLAB setup to run it
at start-up time. 

The Contents.m file includes a high-level description of the routines
included in this package. For more specific information on how to use
a particular routine, type HELP and the routine name under the MATLAB
environment.

There are 3 main directories in this distribution
	./Voice_Source
	./F0_HarmonicAnalysis
	./Loudness
which include various subroutines for the analysis of voice source,
harmonic analysis, and loudness respectively. In addition, the
	./Utils
subdirectory contains various utilities that you may find useful outside
of the above applications. I have also released various MATLAB routines
not authored by me. These are included in
	./Utils/DIN_2045631_V201.4.20
	./Utils/Voicebox
The software included there has been made publically and freely available
before, and has been used here to support the work which I have authored.
I am redistributing it further to facilitate running my code. Note that
there is at least one routine in this package which invokes a licensed 
MATLAB function (e.g., from the Optimization Toolbox), which I'm unable 
to release. So you may need to have access to the appropriate toolboxes 
to run some of the code above.
